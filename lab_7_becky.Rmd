This: I'm Allison and I am editing this file. -Nice one I'm calling you this from now on --Eamon 

I'm Eamon and I'm also editing this file

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
gc_df <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")


```

We are asking is there a significant difference in recommended gun control action for male and female respondents (should guns be easier, harder, or the same difficulty to get?).

On the 1st day the creator did some data science! 

Becky (the creator): Data wrangaling and counts

```{r}

get_guns <- gc_df %>% 
  filter(gender != "NA", make_get_guns != "NA") %>% 
  count(gender, make_get_guns) %>% 
  spread(make_get_guns, n) %>% # Created a contingency table
  select(-gender)

rownames(get_guns) <- c("Female","Male")
```
